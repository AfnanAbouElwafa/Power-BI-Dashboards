I utilized the AdventureWorks dataset, which features transaction processing scenarios for a fictional bicycle manufacturer. 
The primary objective was to develop dashboards that deliver comprehensive insights into sales and product-related information. 
So, I designed the dashboards to provide a clear overview of sales performance and offer valuable insights into product analysis.  

Project phases:  

1- Data Cleaning & Transformation
2- Data Modeling as Star Schema
3- Creation of Appropriate Measures
4- Dashboard Building
